"""Leakage guards for the affine probe's candidate pool.

The probe builds its own retrieval pool, so it needs its own horizon-guard tests
(rule 3): every candidate must satisfy ``t_r + H < origin``. Each test here
asserts a deliberately introduced violation is *caught*, not merely that clean
input passes.
