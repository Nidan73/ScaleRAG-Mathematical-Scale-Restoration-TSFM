"""Controlled synthetic affine probe for the scale-restoration mechanism.

The ScaleRAG critique this module answers is that ``y_restored = y* * sigma_q + mu_q``
is "just denormalisation". Observational results on M5/ETTm2 cannot settle that,
because the affine relationship between a query and its analogue is never known
there. Here it is *imposed*: a query is built as an exact affine image
``x' = a*x + b`` of a known donor motif, so the true analogue and the true
continuation are both known in closed form, and each stage of the pipeline can be
credited or blamed separately.

The probe separates two properties that the observational studies conflate:

``invariance``
    Does the *retrieval* stage still find the correct analogue when the query is
    affinely transformed? Measured as top-1 hit rate against the known donor.

``equivariance``
    Does the *reconstruction* stage map the retrieved future back into the query's
    coordinate system? Measured as forecast error against the known continuation
    ``a*y + b``.

Crossing {raw, znorm} retrieval with {no restoration, query-scale restoration}
isolates which stage is responsible for which failure. Note that only ``znorm``
carries a location term, so only ``znorm`` can be equivariant under a location
shift ``b != 0``; ``mean`` and ``rms`` are scale-only. The frozen M5 configuration
uses ``mean``, so it is scale-equivariant but *not* affine-equivariant — a
distinction this probe measures rather than assumes.

The scale primitives are imported from :mod:`retrieval_faiss` so the probe tests
the frozen definitions rather than a re-derivation of them. No I/O at import.
